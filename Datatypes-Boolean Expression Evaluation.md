# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program

    a = 0 == True
    b = False == False
    c = True + True
    d = False + 9
    
    print("a is", a)
    print("b is", b)
    print("c:", c)
    print("d:", d)

## Output

## Result
The Python program evaluating the expressions and printing the results has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
